Look at the README in [fountainpub.d](./.fountainpub.d/FOUNTAIN-SYNC-README.md) if you want to understand how this works.

If not:

- Clone this repo
- From the root folder, set up the environment:

```
./setup-fountain-sync.sh
```

- Push .fountain files to Github, they will be used to generate .pdf and .html files either pre-commit or, if node is not installed, via Github workflow.
